# Mazerunner-Game

MazeRunner is a Bomberman-inspired game created in Unity. It serves as a proof of concept for my spacetime line generator and collector. As the player moves the avatar through the maze, a line tracker script records the avatar's x and z positions at specified time intervals in a CSV file. 
Although the Python script for rendering the avatar's path as a 3D block is not included in this repository, it can visualize the virtual world line generated by this tracker. Like most projects in these repositories, this game and the line tracker are a work in progress.

## How to Play
- Use your bombs to eliminate all the mutant animals as quickly as possible.
- Navigate the maze using **arrow keys** or **WASD** and **drop bombs with the space bar**.
- Be careful! Enemies, destructible blocks, and even your character can be destroyed by bombs.
- **Goal**: Find the optimal path and clear the maze!
